<h3> This application will allow users to create a profile which will include their
education, skills and interests as well as any other extracurricular skills they may
have. The system will then match students, faculty and staff based on the
information found on the profile as well as a project they would like to collaborate on. </h3>

     <h3> We will be using the client-server model. This model allows us to store user data and task data in Firebase. The information will be provided according to commands from the controller and displayed in the view. We can utilize Firebase embedded authorization and simple search logic.
All the data and user information for our app will be hosted externally by the Firebase system. All the interfaces and guy components will be hosted locally on the userâ€™s client.

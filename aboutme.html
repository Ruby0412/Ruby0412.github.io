   <h1> About Me...</h1>
    <h3> I make a video about myself, watch it now :) </h3>

 <h3> Besides what I mentioned in the video ... </h3>
  <h4> I am a Kopite. The name originates from the nickname of the original bleachers at Anfield, the stadium for Liverpool Football Club. Liverpool supporters, such as me, who regularly populated the Spion Kop bleachers were soon given the name Kopites. </h4>
  <h4> Spion Kop, or the 'Kop,' was no ordinary bleacher. Built without seats and big enough to cram in 30 thousand diehard fans, the Kop was not for the faint of heart. In rain, snow, sun and sleet, the Kop was always filled past capacity and often fans would watch an entire 90 minute match on the back of another Kopite.  </h4>

   <h4>For obvious safety reasons, the Kop is no more. However, its spirit lives on in us Kopites. It is easy to support a club when it wins. But for us Kopties, love of team does not fade as loses pile up. The values I learned in the Koptie community, whether through online connections or watching matches with other Kopites, have permeated into my everyday life. </h4>
   <h4> I have learned that failure does not define who I am, it is how I recover from failure that defines me. Kopites have shown me the value of perseverance of diligence and more importantly of belief. We Kopties, despite not having any physical impact on actual matches, will forever remain a confident bunch. As I move abroad for college, it is these instilled Kopite values that give me confidence that I can face every challenge and recover from every failure I will encounter.
